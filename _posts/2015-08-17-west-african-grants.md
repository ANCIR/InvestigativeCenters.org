The African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR) is inviting West African journalists to apply for five investigative grants.

Preference will be granted to **oil**, **sport**, **water**, **public procurement**, **elections** and **health**.

Each grant is capped at **$1,000**.

Applicants must have a letter of confirmation from a media house, pre-investigations and strong investigative story samples (English or French).

ANCIR's grant is accompanied by our [iLab](/ilab) team's multi-language editors, data, financial, tech and other experts, to help nurture the development of the story and the journalist.

To apply, please email [ksharife@gmail.com](mailto:ksharife@gmail.com) and [esther@codeforafrica.org](mailto:esther@codeforafrica.org).
