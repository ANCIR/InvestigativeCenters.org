**Deadline for applications:** *To Be Announced*

Investigative Dashboard is a transnational collaborative effort to help journalists and civil society expose organized crime and corruption around the world. It hosts three core tools: a crowd-sourced database of information and documents on persons of interest and their business connections, a worldwide list of online databases and business registries, and a research desk where journalists can go for help in sourcing hard to find information.

The Research Desk is run by OCCRP and four global partners: African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ), the International Center for Journalists, and Connectas in the Americas. 

ID is searching for part-time in-country staff in West Africa (Sierra Leone, Angola, Nigeria, Liberia, Ghana, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Niger and Senegal) as well as Southern Africa (Malawi, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Lesotho) to work with us on a case-by-case basis.

Selected candidates will receive training by ID staff. Preference will be given to candidates with intimate knowledge of national/public records (such as corporate, land, tax and other registries), wide network of sources and resources and familiarity with investigative media. 

Candidates will be required to provide ID with a list of databases as part of the application process as well as two samples of work and a resume. Please contact ksharife@gmail.com
