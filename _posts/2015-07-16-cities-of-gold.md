The African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR) is inviting applicants to apply for grants investigating gold mining in Mali, Mauritania, Cote d'Ivoire and other West African countries. 

Each grant is valued at $1000. 

Preference will be provided to applicants that have a letter of confirmation from a media house, pre-investigations and strong investigative story samples (English or French). 

ANCIR's grant is accompanied by our iLab team's multi-language editors, data, financial, tech and other experts, to help nurture the development of the story and the journalist.
