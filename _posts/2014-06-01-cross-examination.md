### Course Details:
Cross-examination is the most effective engine devised for sifting truth from lies. It is the process by which an accusation and denial are evaluated to determine what is true and to unravel, where false, detailed defenses.

This is, quintessentially, the investigative journalist’s craft. Yet the art of the forensic interview is seldom taught to reporters.

ANCIR is changing this, through a series of hands-on courses led by legal professionals. Ghanaian journalists and human rights activists can sign-up for a free two-day workshop, where they will learn to apply courtroom-style cross-examination skills used to sharpen their own performance with difficult interviewees, especially those with something to hide.

The knowledge and use of techniques discussed in the course will allow journalists to better discern the truth of a version supplied to them and to properly discredit false denials.  

This path-breaking course additionally assists journalists in structuring an exposé that is convincing to readers and also legally defensible.  Elements of believability, used by legal prosecutors throughout the world to sift truth from fiction, will be laid bare through course content, audio and visual files, among other resources.

Participants will have access to ongoing support from ANCIR specialists, and will be eligible for investigative story grants offered by ANCIR partners. Previously incubated under the Forum for African Investigative Reporters (FAIR), in 2013, for individual journalists, the course is now offered to media houses across the continent.

The course is free of charge to qualifying media, thanks to the kind sponsorship of Free Press Unlimited (FPU), an ANCIR partner.
