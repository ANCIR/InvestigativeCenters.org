  Investigative Dashboard (ID) Africa operates under the <a href="https://investigativedashboard.org/">Investigative Dashboard (ID)</a> umbrella. The service provides deep mining on corporate data as well as land, mining, aviation, shipping, vehicle, property, and other data resources.
</p>

<p>
  ANCIR provides Africa-wide coverage with in-country researchers based in more one dozen countries including Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria, Ghana, Malawi, South Africa, Namibia, among others. This allows us to conduct deep mining of information that may not be electronically accessible and requires a physical presence.

<p>
  In addition to ID Africa's support in accessing data, we also provide iLab experts, specialised in data, technology, financial and forensics investigation to assist with understanding and using the information. We strive to provide free data to ANCIR members and other African media.
