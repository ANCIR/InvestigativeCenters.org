<p class="lead">ANCIR strengthens African investigative journalism by improving the sustainability and production capacity in muckraking newsrooms.</p>

<p>ANCIR does this by focusing on "business of news" systems that are essential for professional media organisations. This includes building shared technology solutions and data resources, nurturing revenue strategies and business models, and creating opportunities for collaborative, transnational projects.</p>

<p>ANCIR's 16 founders include investigative newsrooms in 14 countries. Member newsrooms cover the entire spectrum, from the continent's largest newspaper, the Sunday Times, to small investigative magazines like Noseweek, to non-profit centers such as iCIR and Maka Angola.</p>
